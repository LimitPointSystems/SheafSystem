/// @deprecated Use depth_first_tr
/// The general depth-first iterator over the intersection of a poset member anchor's
/// whole with its down set. Implemented as a finite state machine with a client
/// selectable state transition function that can be chosen to provide various iteration
/// orders.<br>
/// <br>
/// The iterator returns control to the client so that the it can perform client-defined
/// actions. There are three action types, the PREVISIT_ACTION, the POSTVISIT_ACTION, and
/// the LINK_ACTION, each associated with specific positions in the iteration.
/// The previsit position is immediately before iteration over the cover of the current
/// member begins. The postvisit position is immediately after iteration over the cover
/// ends. The link position is on the current link, immediately after the lesser end of the
/// link has been visited and context has ascended to the current link. The link action
/// thus immediately follows the postvisit action of the lesser member, but the context
/// is different.<br>
/// <br>
/// This iterator visits every link in the cover relation graph below the anchor
/// of the iteration, maintaining a path to the current member. Conceptually, the path
/// is a list of pointers to lower cover iterators. The current member
/// of each iterator is a node in the path. Physically, the path is stored
/// in two parts. _index is the head of the list. The tail of the list is
/// stored in the variable _path. The current link in the graph is
/// the link between the front of _path and _index, with _index being the
/// lesser member of the link.
