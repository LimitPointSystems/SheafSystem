///
/// The monitor concurrency control interface.
/// Class READ_WRITE_MONITOR implements the monitor concurrency control
/// paradigm, as described in Andrews, "Concurrent Programming Principles
/// and Practice".  We have extended Andrews design to incorporate two
/// kinds of clients: threads and objects. The thread client interface
/// corresponds to Andrew's design and is intended to mediate access by
/// multiple clients, each of which is expected to gain appropriate access,
/// execute some piece of code and release access.  The object client
/// interface is intended for use when a client object depends on the
/// monitored object not changing during the lifetime of the client object.
/// The client gains read-only access to the monitored object and releases
/// the access only when it (the client) is deleted. The read access prevents
/// any thread from gaining write access and hence locks the monitored object
/// for the life of the client. The motivating application for the object
/// client interface is the need to lock poset objects which are being used
/// as the schema for some other (client) poset object. <br>
/// <br>
/// Note that the monitor protocol for the per-thread access control only works
/// if three conditions are satisfied: <br>
/// <br>
/// request_precedes_access: <br>
/// every client always requests access before accessing the object <br>
/// <br>
/// request_precedes_release: <br>
///  every release call by this thread is always preceded by a request
///      call by this thread <br>
/// <br>
/// release_follows_request: <br>
///  every request call by this thread is always followed by a release
///      call by this thread <br>
/// <br>
/// The latter two conditions require that request/release always occur in
/// matching pairs. <br>
/// <br>
/// We are currently enforcing request_precedes_access and
/// request_precedes_release via precondition assertions but we are not
/// enforcing release_follows_request because we don't see any way to do it.<br>
/// <br>
/// We sometimes refer to a client that satisfies request_precedes_access as a
/// "polite" client, and a client that satisfies request_precedes_release and
/// release_follows_request as a "proper" client. The read_write_monitor
/// protocol implemented here requires clients to be both polite and proper.
/// <br>
/// A note on constness. "Logically" const member functions (queries) of monitored
/// classes must be able to get and release read access. This implies that
/// get_read_access and release_access must be const; which in turn requires
/// that in this class most of the other member functions are const and all 
/// the data members are mutable.
