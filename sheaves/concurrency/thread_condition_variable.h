  ///          thread has to wait for "condition" to change.  It unlocks the
  ///          mutex, allowing other threads to progress, and waits for a
  ///          signal or broadcast.  When it is awakened by a signal or
  ///          broadcast, it reacquires the lock, and checks "condition",
  ///          repeating this process until "condition" is false.
  /// <dt><dd> <font face="Cursor">unlock_mutex()</font> /// releases the mutex
  ///          lock obtained on the last wakeup from wait().
