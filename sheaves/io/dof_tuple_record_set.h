/// A record_set which contains dof tuple records.
/// Supports both record selection and record restriction (partial records).
///
//// @hack the transparency hack.
//// The io system was originally designed
//// and implemented to provide record selection, restriction, and data
//// type conversion with as little dependence on HDF as possible.
//// A side effect of this was that HDF did not
//// know what the data types in the dof tuple dataset were and the results
//// of h5dump were unreadable. We subsequently hacked the io system to
//// tell HDF what the types were, thus achieving both dump transparency and
//// portability. This left the most of the record and conversion machinery
//// in place, even though it's no longer needed. The io subsystem was
//// hard to understand and maintain before this hack, now it needs to be
//// completely rewritten.
